# READ CAREFULLY

Hi buddies, the following repository is for archiving IORegistryExplorer app for gathering infos about I/O  on macOS. Please note that I do not own any part of the application. This is simply an upload as vulgo GitHub account was taken down.

I'll leave the original link to pay respects: [Press F to pay respects](https://github.com/vulgo/IORegistryExplorer)

Please note that the app is extracted from XCode additional tools and in order to download it, you need an Apple Developer ID.

I'll leave the download link for those who are interested to get XCode Additional Tools directly from Apple ^^: [original link](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?=additional)

You'll find in the Release section of this repo the downloads ^ ^

# Check your SHA256 HASH 

Pro tip: executable binary is under `Contents/MacOS/IORegistryExplorer`

 ~~I don't know how this is even possible but the hashes are the same ._.~~
